This project is a powerful web scraping tool built using Python, Selenium, and ChromeDriver to automate the extraction of laptop specifications from Amazon. It reads a list of laptop model names from a CSV file, intelligently searches for each one on Amazon, and applies a custom relevance scoring algorithm to identify the most accurate product match. The scraper then extracts essential specifications including brand, price, rating, processor, RAM, graphics card, and more. Advanced filtering ensures that sponsored, refurbished, or mismatched listings are skipped. The collected data is structured and saved into a clean CSV format using pandas for further analysis. This scraper simulates an API-like behavior with custom logic for keyword parsing, model matching, and fallback handling, making it a robust solution for large-scale product data collection tasks.
